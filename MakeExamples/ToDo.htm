<h1>Bugs</h1>

<p>
</p>
    <p>The challenge/response scheme is not properly specified</p>

    <p>
    Should specify a limit on the client and server challenge lengths.
    (640 bits should be enough)
    </p>
    <p>
        The DNS transport is not implemented</p>
    <p>
        The UDP transport is not implemented</p>
    <p>
        No provision against replay attacks, this could be significant on a query 
        request. Could solve this with either a &#39;get current time&#39; request (thats a 
        trusted service!) and/or a monotonically increasing counter.</p>
