          <t>
            Alice is an employee of Example Inc. which runs its own
            local omnibroker service 'example.com'.  
To configure her machine for use
            with this service, Alice contacts her network
            administrator who assigns her the account identifier
            'alice' and obtains a PIN number from the service  
            '440270-700N08-F041'
          </t>
          <t>
            Alice enters the values 'alice@example.com' and
            '440270-700N08-F041' into her Omnibroker-enabled  
            Web browser.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            The Web browser uses the local DNS to resolve
            'example.com'
            and establishes a HTTPS connection to the specified IP
             address.
            The client verifies that the certificate presented has
             a valid
            certificate chain to an embedded trust anchor under an  
            appropriate certificate policy (e.g. compliant with
            Extended Validation
            Criteria defined by CA-Browser Forum).
          </t>
          <t>
            Having established an authenticated and encrypted TLS  
            session to the Omnibroker service, the client sends
            an OpenRequest message to begin the process of mutual  
            authentication. This message specifies the
            cryptographic
            parameters supported by the client (Authentication,
            Encryption)
            and a nonce value (Challenge), device identification
            parameters (DeviceID, DeviceURI, DeviceName) and the
            name of the account being requested.
          </t>
          <t>
            The client does not specify the PIN code in the
            request,  
            nor is the request authenticated. Instead the client
            informs
            the server that it has a PIN code that can be supplied
             if
            necessary.

          <t>
            The service receives the request. If the request is
            consistent  
            with the access control policy for the server it
            returns a  
            reply that specifies the chosen cryptographic
            parameters  
            (Cryptographic), responds to the client issued by the  
            client to establish server proof of knowsledge of the
             PIN
            (ChallengeResponse) and issues a challenge to the
            client  
            (Challenge).
          </t>
          <t>
            The cryptographic parameters specify algorithms to be
             used  
            for encryption and authentication, a shared secret and
             a  
            ticket value. Note that while the shared secret is
            exchanged  
            in plaintext form in the HTTP binding, the connection
            protocol MUST provide encryption.

            To complete the transaction, the client sends a
            TicketRequest message
            to the serice containing a response to the PIN
            challenge sent by the
            service (ChallengeResponse).
            The TicketRequest message is authenticated under the
            shared secret specified
            in the OpenResponse message.

<t>
  If the response to the PIN challenge is correct, the service
  responds
  with a message that specifies a set of cryptographic parameters
   to be
  used to authenticate future interactions with the service
  (Cryptographic)  
  and a set of connection parameters for servers supporting the  
  Query Service (Service).
</t>
  <t>
    In this case the server returns three connections, each
    offering a
    different transport protocol option. Each connection specifies
     its
    own set of cryptographic parameters (or will when the code is
     written
    for that).

            When Alice's machine is to be transfered to another
            employee, the  
            Unbind transaction is used. The only parameter
            is the
            Ticket identifying the device association (Ticket).

            Since the unbind response represents the termination
            the
            relationship with the Omnibroker, the response merely
             reports
            the success or failure of the request.

            The 'Ticket' value presented in the foregoing examples
             is  
            a sequence of binary data generated by the service
            is
            opaque to the client. Services MAY generate ticket
            values  
            with a substructure that enable the service to avoid
            the need to maintain server side state.
          </t>
        <t>
          In the foregoing example, the ticket structures generated
          by the service encode the cryptographic parameter data,
          the shared secret, account identifier and an
          authentication  
          value. The initial ticket value generated additionally
          encodes
          the values of the client and service challeng values for
           use
          in calculating the necessary ChallengeResponse.
