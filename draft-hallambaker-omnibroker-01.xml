      <t>
        An Omnibroker is an agent chosen and trusted by an Internet user to
        provide information such as name and certificate status information
        that are in general trusted even if they are not trustworthy.
        Rather than acting as a mere conduit for information provided by
        existing services, an Omnibroker is responsible for curating those
        sources to protect the user.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Omnibroker Protocol (OBP) provides an aggregated interface to
        trusted Internet services including DNS, OCSP and various forms
        of authentication service. Multiple transport bindings are
        supported to permit efficient access in virtually every common
        deployment scenario and ensure access in any deployment
        scenario in which access is not being purposely denied.

    <section title="Purpose">
      <t>
        An Omnibroker is an agent chosen and trusted by an Internet user to
        provide information such as name and certificate status information
        that are in general trusted even if they are not trustworthy.
        Rather than acting as a mere conduit for information provided by
        existing services, an Omnibroker is responsible for curating those
        sources and providing autheticated, curated results to the endpoint
        client.
      </t>
      <t>
        Unlike the traditional trusted information services that are expected
        to deliver the same response to a query regardless of who asks the
        question, OBP permits an Omnibroker to return a response that is
        tailored to the specific party asking the question. This permits the
        use of an authentication approach that has negligible impact
        on performance and permits an
        Omnibroker to answer questions that a traditional public Internet
        information service could not. In particular, an Omnibroker
        can broker peer to peer connections
      </t>
      <section title="A Curated Service">
        <t>
          In the traditional configuration, an Internet host accepts DNS service
          from the IP address specified by the local network provider, frequently
          the DNS server advertised by the local DHCP service. This approach
          creates an obvious security risk as DNS is clearly a trusted service
          and a random DNS service advertised by the local DNS is clearly not
          trustworthy.
        </t>
        <t>
          A policy of only using a chosen DNS service provides a reduction in
          risk but only a modest one since the standard DNS service does not
          provide authenticated results. Many local area networks intercept all
          DNS traffic and process it through the local DNS server regardless
          of the intended destination IP address. This practice is highly
          desirable if it would prevent a client from accessing an untrustworthy
          DNS service in place of a trustworthy local DNS service and
          extreemly undesirable in the contrary case.
        </t>
        <t>
          In addition to ensuring the authenticity of DNS resolution responses,
          such services frequently provide filtering of Internet addresses
          the network provider considers undesirable. Many workplaces block access
          to Web sites that are considered detrimental to productivity.
          Many parent subscribe to services that filter content they consider
          undesirable. While the value of such services is debatable they
          are services that those customers have chosen to deploy on their
          networks to meet their perceived security requirements. New security
          proposals that do not support such capabilities or seek to
          actually circumvent them will not be acceptable to those
          constituencies.
        </t>
        <t>
          While DNS filtering is a form of censorship, not all forms of
          DNS filering are intrinsically undesirable censorship. Spam filtering
          is also a form of censorship albeit one that is not normally
          regarded as such because it most Internet users now consider it to
          be an essential security control. Anti-Virus tools are also a form
          of censorship. DNS filtering tools that block access to sites that
          distribute malware are also a form of censorship and are rapidly
          gaining popularity for the same reason.
        </t>
        <t>
          While all forms of censorship raise civil liberties concerns,
          censorship should not automatically raise civil liberties objections.
          It is not the fact that filtering is taking place but
          the party that is in control of the filtering that should
          raise civil liberties concerns. In an Internet of
          2 billion users, all users are obliged to perform some filtering.
          OBP is designed to make the party that is in control of the
          filtering process apparent and provide the end user with the
          ability to select the Omnibroker of their choice.
        </t>
        <t>
          DNSSEC provides a means of determining that a DNS record is the
          authentic record published by the source but this capability alone
          does not meet the security requirements for DNS resolution services
          as they have come to be understood since the protocol was first proposed.
        </t>
        <t>
          Internet users want to be safe from all forms of attack, not just
          the DNS resolver mani-in-the-middle attack that 'end-to-end'
          deployment of DNSSEC is designed to address. An Internet user is
          far more likely to be directed to a site with a DNS name controlled
          by a criminal gang than be subject to a man-in-the-middle attack.
        </t>
        <t>
          Most users would prefer to have an Internet connection that is
          'curated' to remove at least some of the locations they consider
          to be undesirable. The fact that an organised criminal gang has put
          a host on the Internet does not mean that any other Internet user
          should be obliged to allow it to connect to any of the machines that
          they own.
        </t>
        <t>
          The same argument for curating the raw results applies to
          other forms of trusted information service. The fact that a
          Certificate Authority has issued a digital certificate and
          considers it to be valid should not mean that the end party
          is automatically considered trustworthy by anyone and for
          any purpose.
        </t>
        <t>
          The deployment of security policy capabilities presents another
          case in which direct reliance on raw data is undesirable. While
          security policies such as 'host always offers TLS' or 'mail
          server always signs outgoing mail with DKIM' can provide
          considerable security advantages, only some of the security
          policy information that is published is accurate and kept
          up to date. Curating such data sources typically proves
          essential if an unacceptable rate of false positives is
          to be avoided.
        </t>
        <t>
          Although a client is permitted to curate its own data sources
          it rarely has a sufficient amount of data to make decisions
          as accurately as a network service that can draw on a wide
          variety of additional data including tracking of communication
          patterns, historical data series and third party reputation
          services.
        </t>
        <t>
          Curation in the network offers better asgility than the client
          approach. Agility is an important consideration when an attacker
          changes their strategy rapidly and repeatedly to counter
          new defensive controls.
        </t>
        <t>
          While curating trusted data sources is an established and
          proven practice, current practice has been to curate each
          source individually. This approach avoids the need to write
          a new protocol but limits the information a curator can
          leverage to detect potential danger. Leveraging multiple
          data sources simultaneously allows better accuracy than
          applying each individually.
        </t>

      <section title="Connection Broker">
        <t>
          The OBP service connection broker answers the query 'what connection
          parameters should be used to establish the best connection
          to interract with party X according to protocol Y. Where 'best'
          is determined by the Omnibroker which MAY take into account
          parameters specified by the relying party.
        </t>
        <section title="Service Connection Broker">
          <t>
            The OBP service connection broker supports and extends the traditional
            DNS resolution service that resolves a DNS name (e.g. www.example.com) to
            return an IP address (e.g. 10.1.2.3).
          </t>
          <t>
            When using an Omnibroker as a service connection broker, a client
            specifies both the DNS name (e.g. www.example.com) and the
            Internet protocol to be used (e.g. _http._tcp). The returned
            connection parameters MAY include:
          </t>
          <t>
            <list>
              <t>
                The IP protocol version, address and port number to
                establish a connection to.
              </t>
              <t>
                If appropriate, a security transport such as TLS or IPSEC.
              </t>
              <t>
                If appropriate, a description of a service credential such
                as a TLS certificate or a constraint on the type of certificates
                that the client should consider acceptable.
              </t>
              <t>
                If appropriate, application protocol details such as
                version and protocol options.
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            If an attempt to connect with the parameters specified fails, a
            client MAY report the failure and request a new set of parameters.
          </t>

        </section>
        <section title="Peer Connection Broker">
          <t>
            Each OBP request identifies both the account under which the
            request is made and the device from which it is made. An OBP broker
            is thus capable of acting as a peer connection broker service
            or providing a gateway to such a service.
          </t>
          <t>
            When using Omnibroker as a peer connection broker, a client
            specifies the account name and DNS name of the party with which
            a connection is to be established (e.g. alice@example.com)
            and the connection protocol to be used (e.g. _xmpp-client._tcp)
          </t>
          <t>
            The returned
            connection parameters are similar to those returned in response to a
            service broker query.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Connection Broker API">
          <t>
            In the traditional BSD sockets API a network client performs
            a series of calls to resolve a network name to a list of IP
            addresses, selects one and establishes an IP connection to
            a port specified by the chosen application protocol.
          </t>

          <t>
            OBP anticipates a higher level abstract API that encapsulates
            this complexity, hiding it from the application code.
          </t>
          <t>
            In the case that one (or more) OBP services are configured,
            the library supporting the SHOULD obtain connection parameters
            from the OBP service. Otherwise, it SHOULD establish a connection
            using the traditional calling sequence of resolving a host
            name to obtain an IP address, etc.
          </t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Service Advertisement">
        <t>
          Service advertisement is the converse of service resolution. An
          Internet application wishing to accept inbound connections specifies
          one or more sets of connection parameters for the Omnibroker to
          register with whatever naming, discovery or other services may
          be appropriate.
        </t>
        <t>

        </t>
        <section title="Connection Advertisement API">
          <t>
            OBP anticipates the use of a high level API for connection advertisement
            that is the converse of the Connection broker API. Instead
            of establishing a connection, the API is used to advertise
            that a connection is offered either as a service or a peer.
          </t>

          <t>
            An application MAY offer multiple types of connection with
            different connection properties (e.g. IPv4/IPv6, with and
            without SSL, etc.). This MAY be supported by marking certain
            properties as being optional and/or by permitting the
            API to be called multiple times with different properties
            specified.

      <section title="Credential Validation Broker">
        <t>
          A credential validation broker reports on the validity and
          trustworthiness of credentials presented to a client by Internet
          services and/or peers.
        </t>
        <t>
          The service provided by OBP is similar to that provided by
          OCSP and SCVP. Like SCVP, OBP is an agent selected by the
          relying party to validate certificates and/or construct
          trust paths on its behalf.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Authentication Gateway">
        <t>
          Every OBP request is strongly authenticated by means of a shared
          secret that is unique to the account and the device. This may be
          leveraged to permit use as an authentication gateway, providing
          access to other credentials that the client has established the
          right to use.
        </t>
        <t>
          An Authentication Gateway MAY provide access to account names and
          passwords that the account holder has chosen to store in the cloud for
          access to sites that do not support a stronger,
          cryptographically based form of
          authentication such as OAuth.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Credential Announcement">
        <t>
          An Authentication Gateway can only provide access to credentials
          that it has notice of. A client uses the Credential Announcement
          transaction to advise the service of a new credential.

    <section title="Omnibroker Connection Maintenance Service">

      <section title="Authentication">
        <t>
          The principle function of the OBP Connection Maintenance Protocol
          is to establish and maintain the cryptographic parameters
          used to authenticate and encrypt
        </t>
        <t>
          The user needs to authenticate the broker service regardless
          of any authentication requirements of the broker.
        </t>
        <section title="Broker Authentication">


          <t>

            The OBP connection maintenance protocol transport MUST provide
            a trustworthy means of verifying the identity of the broker
            (e.g. an Extended Validation SSL certificate).
          </t>
          <t>
            If the device supports a display capability, authentication of the
            device and user MAY be achieved by means of an authentication
            image. Such an authentication image is generated by the broker and
            passed to the client in the OpenResponse message. The user then
            verifies that the image presented on the device display is the same
            as that presented on the account maintenance console.
          </t>

        </section>
        <section title="Device Authentication">
          <t>
            If device authentication is required, the mechanism to be used depends on
            the capabilities of the device, the requirements of the broker and
            the existing relationship between the user and the broker.
          </t>

          <t>
            If the device supports some means of data entry, authentication
            MAY be achieved by entering a passcode into the device that was
            previously delivered to the user out of band.
          </t>
          <t>
            The passcode authentication mechanism allows the device to establish
            a proof that it knows the passcode without disclosing the passcode.
            This property provides protection against Man-In-The-Middle type
            disclosure attacks.

            Alice is an employee of Example Inc. which runs its
             own
            local omnibroker service 'example.com'.  
To configure her machine for use
            with this service, Alice contacts her network
            administrator who assigns her the account identifier
            'alice' and obtains a PIN number from the service  
            '7V0920-2A6D07-P03R'

          <t>
            Alice enters the values 'alice@example.com' and

            Web browser.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            The Web browser uses the local DNS to resolve

            The client verifies that the certificate presented

            certificate chain to an embedded trust anchor under
             an  
            appropriate certificate policy (e.g. compliant with

            Alice is an employee of example.com which runs its own
            local omnibroker service. To configure her machine for use
            with this service, Alice contacts her network
            administrator who assigns her the account identifier
            'alice' and obtains a PIN number from the service 
            '1V0FH0-3KSF01-501M'
          </t>
          <t>
            Alice enters the values 'alice@example.com' and
            '1V0FH0-3KSF01-501M' into her Omnibroker-enabled 
            Web browser.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            The Web browser uses the local DNS to resolve 'example.com'
            and establishes a HTTPS connection to the specified IP address.
            The client verifies that the certificate presented has a valid
            certificate chain to an embedded trust anchor under an 
            appropriate certificate policy (e.g. compliant with the Extended Validation
            Criteria defined by CA-Browser Forum).

          <t>
            Having established an authenticated and encrypted TLS 
            session to the Omnibroker service, the client sends
            an OpenRequest message to begin the process of mutual 
            authentication. This message specifies the cryptographic
            parameters supported by the client (Authentication, Encryption)
            and a nonce value (Challenge), device identification
            parameters (DeviceID, DeviceURI, DeviceName) and the
            name of the account being requested.

          <t>
            The client does not specify the PIN code in the initial request, 
            nor is the request authenticated. Instead the client informs
            the server that it has a PIN code that can be supplied if

            If specified, identifies the cryptographic key and algorithm parameters to be used

          <t hangText="Payload [Required]">
            If the ticket context does not specify use of an encryption algorithm,
            contains the message data. Otherwise contains the
